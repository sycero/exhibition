### What I learned

Building responsive website is very essential because most of the people in the world today are using smart phones so therefore it must bhe taken into great consideration to make your pages work well on these small screens too.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```




### Continued development

i will made the element in a way that it can increase in size when hover3d upon as some smart phones need the scan element to be extra big before it could be scanned compared to other smartphones.


### Useful resources

I used references from w3 schools when ever i could not recall a synthax. I have learned to understand that it is not the number of lines in the code that count but the effeciency in delivery result that count. So better to understand than to memorize synthax.
